 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation point.  
It is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that demonstrates the complete data science workflow.
## 📌 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict the survival of Titanic passengers using historical data.
## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
## 📂 Dataset Information
- Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset  
- Source: Kaggle  
- Total Records: 891 passengers  
- Target Variable: `Survived`  
  - `0` → Did Not Survive  
  - `1` → Survived  
## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values in age and other columns.
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical form.
   - Removed unnecessary columns.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed survival rate based on gender, class, and age.
   - Visualized data using graphs and charts.

4. **Feature Selection**
   - Selected important features for model training.

5. **Model Training**
   - Applied Machine Learning algorithm(s) to train the model.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy score.
## 📊 Results
- The trained model predicts passenger survival with good accuracy.
- The results show that factors like gender and passenger class play an important role in survival.
